# A list contains the name of the cricketer, his age, the number of test matches that he has played, and the average runs that he has scored in each test match.

# (i) Read the list and arrange them in ascending order based on average runs.
# (ii) List the cricketerâ€™s name who have scored more than 100 runs.
# (iii) Use explicit parameters to pass the parameters name and age and calculate the average age of the players.
